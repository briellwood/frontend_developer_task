# Front End Developer technical task

This test aims to measure the quality of your HTML and CSS, ability to use user data to personalise an experience, and tracking considerations. The individual parts will be written as a requirement that has come in from a Product owner. We have included some very basic html files to spoof an order journey that you can use.

You may spend as much time as you like on this test.

### Test 1 – HTML/CSS/Responsive test

The files for this design are in the Test1 folder. There are designs for a desktop and mobile version of the page. The tracking doesn’t need to be done in analytical software, this could be spoofed in the console.


>*Update the homepage with the new designs in the PSD , attached (Test1 folder). *
>*Banner*
>*Title: Welcome to Pharmacy2U*
>*Subtitle: Free delivery on all NHS prescriptions*
>*Primary CTA: Login*
>*Secondary CTA: Register.*
>*oth CTAs should be individually trackable in GA and link through to the login page.*

### Test 2 – Personalisation of experience

This would normally be done through an A/B testing tool, we’d suggest spoofing this with some vanilla JS to update the content created in step 1. The updated design is in the Test2 folder.

>*For returning customers the banner on the homepage should be updated to include the users name and the image updated to the attached (Test2 folder)*
>*Banner copy should be: Hi, <firstname> we’re now connected to your GP*

### Test 3 – Tracking of user through the journey

We have included a very basic order summary and order confirmation page to link to. For this test both CTAs on the homepage banner should link to the order summary page. Feel free to tidy up these pages as you see fit, but is not essential to the test.

>*For a first user who lands on the homepage and clicks on the Register CTA we want to change the message on the confirmation page from “Thank you for your order” to – “Thank you for your first order”*
>*For a returning user who lands on the homepage and clicks on the Login CTA we want to change the message on the confirmation page from “Thank you for your order” to – “Thank you for ordering from Pharmacy2U”*
>*On the order summary page if we have the users first name please update the h1 from “Order summary” to “Hi, <firstname>, below is summary of your order”*
